Due to the large size of the dataset (~500 MB), we've uploaded it to Google Drive. You can access the dataset via the link provided in the accompanying pdf document named "DatasetLink".


WOE 
The WoE dictionary was created to quantify the relationship between categorical feature levels and the target variable (flight delay) in a way that preserves predictive power and avoids issues like overfitting or multicollinearity. We created the WoE dictionary to give values to the weather data while combining it with out dataset.
