1. Dataset.pdf - Due to the large size of the dataset (~500 MB), we've uploaded it to Google Drive. You can access the dataset via the link provided in the accompanying pdf document named "DatasetLink".
2. Decoding_Airline_delays.ipynb - contains the main code logic.
3. Weather_Data_Collection.ipynb - contains logic for combining weather data with original dataset for enriching the data. Weather data was sourced from https://www.visualcrossing.com/
4. WOE 
The WoE dictionary was created to quantify the relationship between categorical feature levels and the target variable (flight delay) in a way that preserves predictive power and avoids issues like overfitting or multicollinearity. We created the WoE dictionary to give values to the weather data while combining it with out dataset.
